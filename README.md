# Events Post Type
Add an events CPT to your WordPress site. Requires ACF.

If needed, add support for additional taxonomies to the post type using the ```register_taxonomy_for_object_type``` function. See: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy_for_object_type.

If an ACF Google Maps API key is not already specified on your site, you can enter an API key authorized for use with the Google Maps JavaScript API and Google Geocoding API under Settings > Events Post Type.

TODO:

- include templates but allow override (see SMO)
- convert to class(es) / split into files?
