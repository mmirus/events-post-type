# Events Post Type
Add an events CPT to your WordPress site. Requires ACF.

If needed, add support for additional taxonomies to the post type using the ```register_taxonomy_for_object_type``` function. See: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy_for_object_type.

TODO:

- include templates but allow override (see SMO)
- convert to class(es) / split into files?
